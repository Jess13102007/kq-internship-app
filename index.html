    <h2>My Projects</h2>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Fill-Finish Optimization Project</h3>
      <img src="images/fill-finish.png" alt="Fill-Finish Project Screenshot" />
      <p>Used Python (pandas, seaborn, sklearn) to analyze and optimise manufacturing efficiency. I trained a Random Forest model to identify key variables impacting fill accuracy.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3> Tennis Ball Spin Physics Experiment</h3>
      <img src="images/tennis-spin.png" alt="Physics Experiment Screenshot" />
      <p>Led a physics investigation to test how spin rate affects velocity at constant applied force using the magnus effect. We used software, video tracking, and mechanics knowledge to analyze results.</p>

    <h2>Fun Fact!</h2>
    <p>I once coded a chatbot to talk like Shakespeare — badly. It only spoke in sonnets, but had no idea what it was saying.</p>
