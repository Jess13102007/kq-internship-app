            <h3>Fill-Finish Manufacturing Project</h3>
            <p>This project aimed to improve fill-finish accuracy in pharmaceutical manufacturing through data analysis and predictive modelling. I used Python libraries including <code>pandas</code>, <code>seaborn</code>, <code>scikit-learn</code>, and <code>RandomForestRegressor</code> to identify key variables and reduce variability in production outcomes.</p>
            <p>The project was overseen by <strong>Gwyn Jones, Head of Process Mechanical of the PM Group</strong>, who provided technical feedback and industry insight.</p>
            <blockquote>
              "I was genuinely in awe of the detailed research undertaken, presentation skills, intuition and the cross-discipline thinking. Some of the ideas had me stumped. Issues on data security, ethical issues of AI decision models on safety critical equipment and a whole host of others."

            <p>Beyond technical skills, I’m passionate about representation in STEM. As a young woman in tech, I strive to be a role model in my school community. I was recently featured in our school's introductory video to inspire more students, especially girls, to pursue technology and other science-related subjects.</p>
          <blockquote>
              "Jess has shown exceptional resilience to handle commitments at home with attending school and engaging fully with activities in school. She is always willing to be involved with our events, and had an excellent input to our introductory video to the school. She is an excellent role model for girls interested in pursuing STEM subjects at sixth form level."

          <p>During one of these visits, I even won a small informal competition designed to develop our soft skills, which gave me more confidence in my ability to express and translate ideas.</p>
