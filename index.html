    <h2>My Projects</h2>

    <div class="project">
  <h3>Fill-Finish Optimization Project</h3>
  <img src="images/fill-finish.png" alt="Fill-Finish Project Screenshot" />
  <p>This project aimed to improve fill-finish accuracy in pharmaceutical manufacturing through data analysis and predictive modeling. I used Python libraries including <code>pandas</code>, <code>seaborn</code>, <code>scikit-learn</code>, and <code>RandomForestRegressor</code> to identify key variables and reduce variability in production outcomes.</p>

  <p>The project was overseen by <strong>Gwyn Jones, Head of Process Mechanical of the PM Group</strong>, who provided technical feedback and industry insight.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “I was genuinely in awe of the detailed research undertaken, presentation skills, intuition and the cross-discipline thinking. Some of the ideas had me stumped. Issues on data security, ethical issues of AI decision models on safety critical equipment and a whole host of others.”

    <div class="project">
      <h3> Tennis Ball Spin Physics Experiment</h3>
      <img src="images/tennis-spin.png" alt="Physics Experiment Screenshot" />
      <p>Led a physics investigation to test how spin rate affects velocity at constant applied force using the magnus effect. We used software, video tracking, and mechanics knowledge to analyze results.</p>

  <h2>My Experience with the Knowledge Quarter</h2>

  <img src="images/kq-visit.jpg" alt="Photo from KQ Visit" class="kq-photo" />

  <p>I’ve had the opportunity to visit the Knowledge Quarter before. I took part in workplace tours and attended talks that gave me an insight into how this type of work really happen in practice.</p>
  <p>During one of these visits, I even won a small informal competition designed to develop our soft skills, which gave me more confidence in my ability to express and translate ideas. </p>
